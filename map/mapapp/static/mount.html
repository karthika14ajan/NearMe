    <p>Mount Fuji is Japan’s tallest and most famous mountain, standing at 3,776 meters. It is a stratovolcano located on Honshu Island, about 100 km from Tokyo. Known for its perfectly symmetrical cone shape, Mount Fuji is considered a symbol of Japan and is often featured in art, photography, and literature.

The mountain is also a sacred site in Japanese culture, with many pilgrims and tourists climbing it during the official climbing season in summer. Surrounding it are beautiful lakes, forests, and shrines, making it a major natural and cultural landmark.</p>
