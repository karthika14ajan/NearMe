    <p>Tokyo Tower is a famous landmark in Tokyo, Japan, built in 1958 and standing 333 meters tall. Its design is inspired by the Eiffel Tower, but it is lighter and painted bright orange and white to meet safety rules. The tower is used for broadcasting TV and radio signals and is a major tourist spot. It has two observation decks that offer wide views of the city, and the base building, called FootTown, includes shops, museums, and restaurants. At night, the tower is beautifully lit, making it one of Tokyo’s most recognizable symbols.</p>
