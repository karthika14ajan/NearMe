    <p>Mount Fuji is Japan’s tallest and most famous mountain, standing at 3,776 meters. It is a stratovolcano located on Honshu Island, about 100 km from Tokyo. Known for its perfectly symmetrical cone shape, Mount Fuji is considered a symbol of Japan and is often featured in art, photography, and literature.

The mountain is also a sacred site in Japanese culture, with many pilgrims and tourists climbing it during the official climbing season in summer. Surrounding it are beautiful lakes, forests, and shrines, making it a major natural and cultural landmark.</p>

    <p>Tokyo Tower is a famous landmark in Tokyo, Japan, built in 1958 and standing 333 meters tall. Its design is inspired by the Eiffel Tower, but it is lighter and painted bright orange and white to meet safety rules. The tower is used for broadcasting TV and radio signals and is a major tourist spot. It has two observation decks that offer wide views of the city, and the base building, called FootTown, includes shops, museums, and restaurants. At night, the tower is beautifully lit, making it one of Tokyo’s most recognizable symbols.</p>
